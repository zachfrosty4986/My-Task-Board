# My-Task-Board
The Purpose of this webpage is to easily sort to-do topics into definable categories. On each task card, the title, due date and the description are visulized on each task element. The cards can be dragged into 3 definable categories for further organization. 

When a user enters the site, they can click the "add task" button to prompt a modal to fill out all the task information. Once all of the information is filled, the user can click the "create task? button on the modal and a new task card will appear in the "to-do" section. The card then can be moved into the "in-progress" section when a task is in prgress, ad finally, it can be dragged and dropped into the "done" section when the task is complete. The user can also click the red delete button at any time to delete the task card from local stroage and from the page. If the user refreshes the browser or closes the window, when they returned, the task cards will appear in the same spots they were left in prior. 

This assignment allowed me to greatly expand my knowledge in JaaScript functions and how they operate. There were a lot of challenges along with this project, but I was able to acheive full functionality!
